## The Why

When I ask people **why** they want a website, I hear these kinds of answers:
- I want more followers
- I want to show off my portfolio
- I want to show I am professional 
- Every company is doing it, so I need it to
- I want to sell online
- I want make more sales
- Hell! I want to make money!

Of course money. But here, **money** is the result of what we do, not why we do it. It’s way too limiting.
 
I thought long and hard about this question and trust me, here is the best answer I could come up with.

I **believe** that you and I and all organizations really, 
we are craving to have an impresario that represents us. 

Let me repeat this.

I **believe** the reason why we want a website, 
is that we are CRAAAA-VING to have an impresario 
that speaks in our name, an impresario that represents us.

Who doesn’t want to have someone or an entity that will speak up and say about:
- how great we are
- how cool we are
- how much we can be trusted
- how serious we are to have built this brand 
- and hopefully on the other side of that coin
	how human we are to not hide behind a logo.

Who doesn’t want that?

Actually, this is what we at FirePress:
We empower freelancers and organizations to build an outstanding mobile-first website, that speak up for them. 

I **believe** that most of us have something to bring
and to share with the world. 

I **believe** we are looking to, put our touch — to do a little difference on how the world should be. 

I **believe** we should plant our own flag on the web. 
(and if you ask me... stop relying on only renting a flat on social networks)
This flag does not represent a **country**, but instead, 
it tells who we are, what we do and why we are doing it.

I **believe** that a brand is more than anything, a promise that we can execute on our offer.

I **believe** trust is one of the most important asset we can own and this trust can only be build by people who are playing for the long run,
by people who are not looking for the shortcut. 

I **believe** marketing wants to accomplish 3 things:
- create **awareness**
- build **trust** and
- drive people **to act**. 

Remember the impresario I just talked about?
Well ... go for it and meet your impresario 
on this place you call your website. 
Let him speak up for you.

I have this **vision** for the future,
that like having an email address, 
a Facebook account, a smart phone…
I see that it will soon goes without saying …
that everyone will own it's website.
It will be the extension of who we are.

**Statistics** shows that within the next 5 years, more than half of the active population is US will get some revenues from freelance work.

and I **believe** Freelancers don’t wait to get picked but instead they create their own windows of opportunities.

When I **realized** that we all expect to have everything available on our phone, it became clear to me. This moment of clarity is why I decided to build FirePress for people like you:
for the artist at heart
for the creator
for those who lead
for the makers
for those who believe in a cause greater than themselvesù
for the ones that ship dreams
While some may say they are losing their time, 
we see men and women, who have picked their battles.

Because the peoples who decide to go against the odds, 
are the one who can beat them.

Let me **leave you** on this:
Can we find you and what you have to offer on this phone? 
If the answer is not a big **Hell yes**
Let me help you.
