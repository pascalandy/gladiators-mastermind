Hi Denis, Luz and Pascal,

This exercise seems to be bringing me a lot of peace, abundance, fun and energy.  Here you go if you want to give it a try:

Option 1:  Everywhere I believe it’s truth that _______________________________(whatever negative talk is in your head) I make it an untruth now.

I clear - cancel - delete it. 
I resolve it - dissolve it and transmute it across all times, spaces, dimensions and realities.

It is done. It is done. It is done.

What if……………?(ONLY positive wording here)
What if……………?
What if……………?

Do as many or few "what if’s" as you wish. This is supposed to be easy and simple.

You can write or talk or do recordings of yourself and listen just before you go to bed.

Sending love,

Jill xo xo xo
